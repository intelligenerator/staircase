## Getting Started

Follow these instructions to get a working copy on your machine using git.

### Prerequisites

You should have python3 installed on your machine. If not, you can install it
from the official website https://www.python.org/. There are no python
dependencies.

To copy this project (=repository) to your local machine, you'll need to use
git. If you do not have git installed, you can get it at https://git-scm.com/.

If you would like to clone this repository using the graphical user interface
Github Desktop, make sure you've got it installed and configured correctly.
Read more on their website: https://desktop.github.com/

### Cloning with Github Desktop

Follow the instructions in [Github-Desktop.md](./Github-Desktop.md).

### Cloning with Terminal

Choose a folder to which you would like to download this repository to, e.g.
`Desktop` or `Documents`.

Navigate to that folder and open it in a terminal. On MacOs, this can be done by
right-clicking on the folder and going to `Services` > `New Terminal at Folder`.

In the terminal, run the following command by pasting it in and hitting `Enter`:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/intelligenerator/staircase.git
```

You can now move into this folder by executing:

```bash
cd staircase
```

Happy Coding!

## Coding

Read through the instructions in [src/Instructions.md](src/Instructions.md)
before implementing your solution in [`src/staircase.py`](src/staircase.py).

Once you have implemented and tested your solution, feel free to open a
Pull Request (=PR) in this repo.

> Hint: If you are stuck, a possible solution is implemented on the "solution"
> branch. You can view the solution
> [here](https://github.com/intelligenerator/staircase/blob/solution/src/staircase.py)

## Testing

To run a predefined test suite, run `staircase.test.py` with python3
